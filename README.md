# Analysis of Weather Obeservation on Jan 27, 2021

  ### Analyzed the weather of 565 randomly selected citites from different latitude and longitude. Analyzed the cloudiness, wind speed, temperature and humidity of the randomly selected cities. Information about all the cities were collected on Jan 27, 2021 at the same times. The purpose of th analysis is to decide on a desitination to for vacation. The criteria for selecting the city for vacation is based on temperature, wind speed less than10 and zero cloudiness. 
 
 
  ### Here are the some of the obwervations made using the analysis.
  
  ### As we move away from the equator towards the poles the temperature decreases. The decrease is not linear. Also, for each latitude there seems to be a range of temperautres.
  
  ### However if we split the data forteh norhtern and southern hemispheres, there seems to be linear relationships between the temperature and the latitude. Also the relationship is lot more pronouced in the case of nothern hemisphere than in the case of southern hemiphere. This could be due to the lack of data in the far southern latitudes.
